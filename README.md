# Line Follower

My second project of the freshman year is also the second introduction to the design and prototyping of a mechatronic system, namely a line follower. In a line tracking system, micro-controllers, sensors, actuators and programming play a very important role. I built the line follower in a group of 2 students. The line follower is controlled by a micro-controller. The line follower uses a system of sensors, either digital or analogue. It must also be possible to follow a black line and prevent collisions. Furthermore, the choice of the battery, the control of the motors, the wheels and the programming are of great importance.
